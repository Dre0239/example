## GItFlow

1. Create your repository and clone it (Don't make a nested folder!)

2. Immediately create a new branch with git checkout -b <branch name>

3. Make your edits under that branch (have your temrinal help you know which branch you're on)

4. git status to check which files are changed

5. If we see files in red that we want to stage for a commit, then git add <filename> or git add . to add all files

6. Perform a git commit -m"<indicate what you changed about the code>"

7. git push
